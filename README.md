Hello thanks for downloading my jarvis 


NOTE:
From line 80 to 89 

elif 'open discord' in query:

            discordPath = ""
            os.startfile(discordPath)


just add your loction for the file: discordPath = "" 


you can  change your name by going to 
line number 19 to 30 instead of sir add your name
